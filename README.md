School assignment for CS-351 Website Development

Webpage that calculates mortgage using servlets. JavaScript performs form validation. A simplified model of mortgage is used. Given the principal amount, interest rate, and monthly payment, this program calculates how long it will take to pay off the mortgage and how much is spent on interest. A log of calculations is saved using session attributes, and previous inputs can be clicked on to be added to the calculator's fields.
